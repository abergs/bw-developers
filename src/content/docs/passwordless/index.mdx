Bitwarden Passwordless.dev is a software toolkit that helps developers build [FIDO2 WebAuthn-based passkey](concepts.md#fido2) features into websites and enterprise applications for seamless authentication flows.

Using Passwordless.dev means there's no need to read extensive W3C specification documentation, determine what cryptography to implement, or worry about managing stored public keys. The team behind Bitwarden will take care of that for you.

Passwordless.dev wraps passkey authentication for your website in easy-to-use tools, designed to make it faster for web developers to adopt, and meet the challenges of an ever-shifting cybersecurity landscape.

The Passwordless.dev architecture consists of three key parts:

- A [client side library](frontend/javascript.md), used by your frontend to make requests to end-users browsers' WebAuthn API and requests to the Passwordless.dev APIs.
- A public RESTful API, used by the client-side library to complete FIDO2 WebAuthn cryptographic exchanges with the browser.
- A [private RESTful API](api.md), used by your backend to initiate key registrations, verify sign-ins, and retrieve keys for end-users.

All Passwordless.dev code is [open source](https://github.com/passwordless).
