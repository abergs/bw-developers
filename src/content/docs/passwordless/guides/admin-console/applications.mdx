## Get started

The **Get Started** page walks you through the preliminary steps for getting Passwordless.dev running in your application. This information is very similar to what's documented in the [Get Started](../../getting-started) guide.

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning">
  This page contains your [API keys](../../references/concepts#api-keys). It's important to download your API keys to a safe place, as they will be removed from the admin console after 7 days.
</Aside>

## Playground

The **Playground** page gives access to a simple passwordless demo you can use for testing devices.

## Users

The **Users** page allows you to monitor the end-users with passkeys registered for your application. For each user, as determined by their `userId`, you'll be able to view:

### Credentials

Credentials registered to each user are listed. [Learn what data is stored for each credential](../../references/concepts#credential).

### Aliases

Aliases registered to each user are listed, however aliases that are hashed cannot be viewed here ([learn more](../../references/passwordless-api-reference#alias)).

## Settings

The **Settings** page will offer some options for configuring your application, including what [plan](https://bitwarden.com/products/passwordless/#pricing) your application is on. More to come.

### Api key management

There are several operations you can perform on your API keys:

| Operation | Condition           | Reversible | Description                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lock      | API key is unlocked | Yes        | Locking an API key will prevent it from being used. You will typically receive a 403 HTTP status code.                                |
| Unlock    | API key is locked   | Yes        | Unlocking an API key will allow it to be used again.                                                                                  |
| Create    |                     | Yes        | Creating an API key will allow you to interact with the Passwordless.dev API. You are allowed to create as many API keys as you like. |
| Delete    | Api key is locked   | No         | Deleting an API key will permanently remove it.                                                                                       |

### Manually Generated Authentication Tokens

Manually Generated Authentication Tokens allow you to create a custom sign-in flow specific to your application. This could be incredibly useful in account recovery, identity verification, etc. To enable this feature, go to the **Settings** page, scroll to the **Manually Generated Authentication Tokens** section, check the box, and click Save.

You should now be able to call `https://v4.passwordless.dev/signin/generate-token` to retrieve a manually generated authentication token to be used to sign-in without a passkey. For more information, please refer to the [documentation](../../references/passwordless-api-reference#signin-generate-token).

### Magic Links

Magic Links provides you with the ability to email your users a link that will redirect them to your application without having to configure your own email provider. This feature can be enabled by going to the **Settings** page, scrolling to the **Magic Links** section, checking the box, and clicking Save.

You should now be able to call `https://v4.passwordless.dev/magic-links/send` to send Magic Link emails to your users. For more information, please refer to the [documentation](../../references/passwordless-api-reference#magic-links).

### Authentication Configuration

Authentication configuration allows you further customization into how your users authenticate with your application.  By default, the `sign-in` and `step-up` purposes are enabled for users to log in.

For each configuration, you are able to control the user verification requirement and the expiration of the verify token issued by `/signin/complete`.
